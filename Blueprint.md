# YinGAN Rune Engine - Project Blueprint

## 1. Overview
YinGAN Rune Engine is a lightweight web-based framework for creating, storing, and visualizing ‚ÄúRunes‚Äù ‚Äî symbolic data units that represent AI-related assets such as prompts, text, audio, or images.

The project aims to provide a modular interface for users and developers to manage, generate, and retrieve Runes efficiently across multiple AI models and storage services.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Simplify AI data encapsulation into a readable, transferable JSON format.
- Provide a front-end tool for non-technical users to generate structured Runes.
- Enable multi-modal (text, image, audio) support for AI-related content.
- Support cloud storage (Google Drive / Firebase) for Rune data.
- Prepare for future integration with vector databases and embedding systems.

---

## 3. Current State (v0.1)
‚úÖ Implemented:
- Basic front-end interface (HTML + CSS + JS)
- Input form for Rune Name, Description, and File upload
- Dynamic JSON generation and preview on-page
- GitHub repository setup and version control

---

## 4. Next Steps (v0.2)
üéØ Planned:
- Integrate cloud storage for file uploads (Google Drive API)
- Save Rune JSON to local storage or Firestore database
- Add Rune card display and basic search/filtering UI
- Optimize interface for mobile browsers

---

## 5. Future Vision (v3.0+)
üöÄ Long-term goals:
- Multi-agent Rune collaboration system
- Cultural and semantic vector embedding (YinGAN model)
- AI-assisted Rune synthesis (text + audio + visual)
- API hub for model-to-model communication
- Visual ‚ÄúRune Map‚Äù interface for navigation and memory linking
